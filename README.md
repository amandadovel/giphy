# Giphy üèÇüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This app uses a giphy API to collect different gifs corresponding to a particular theme. This page has multiple buttons on the top and a search bar. By clicking on one of the buttons a list of still gifs will show up on the screen. User can click on an image to make it animate and click again to make it stop. By searching in the input box, user will add searched item to the list of buttons at the top of the screen. That button will also supply a list of gifs that will animate by clicking on them.
